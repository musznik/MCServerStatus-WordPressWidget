* Enabled query listener, can't get server data, it may be that your website hosting provider doesn't allow requests, you can try setting query port to 25565 (`query.port=25565`) in `server.properties` file and then testing it.
* If you still can't, please contact your website hosting provider.

If query listener cannot be used, it automatically switches to ping.
